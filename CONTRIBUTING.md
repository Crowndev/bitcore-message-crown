What's Different
================

This repo, bitcore-message-crown, is based on the `98a54319246bfabd442f94cac42ab5c9486d3b46` commit of the official bitcore-message. We have replaced some parameters by looking up the Crown Core.

Message's magic bytes `"Crown Signed Message:\n"` can be found in Core's `src/main.cpp`.

The following is the original contributing guide of bitcore-lib.
